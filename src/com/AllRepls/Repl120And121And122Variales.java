Repl 124


Declare static variable in class level as below and assign its value:

String ss="Welcome To Syntax Technologies"

Access variable in the main method and print it using three ways you learned so far

Hint:

first way: By calling directly

Second way: By using the className

Third way: By creating the object of the class

**Expected Output:**

```
Welcome To Syntax Technologies
```

```
Welcome To Syntax Technologies
```

```

```



Repl 125

**For you to do:**

Declare a static variable **number** that will hold an integer value:

Access **number** from the main method and assign value to it.

Create an Object of the class, access **number** in a nonstatic way and assing value of 200.

Print out **number** using class name and using instance

**Expected Output:**

```
200
```

```
200
```




Repl 126

**For you to do:**

Create a variable that will hold the count of all instances of the Main class

Create 3 Object of the class and print value of the count variable;

**Expected Output:**

```
3
```

Solution
**For you to do:**
